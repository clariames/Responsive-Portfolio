        <p>Hello! My name is María Clarissa Martínez Ames and I’m 26 years old. I’m from Tijuana, Baja California, a border city. I really enjoy living here, it has all kinds of perks being so close to the US, as well as its downsides.</p>
            <p>I have a bachelors degree in Visual Information Design from Universidad de las Américas Puebla. I lived in Puebla for almost five years and I miss it so much, it’s such a beautiful, calm city with a lot of history and tradition, as well as some really really delicious food. For a while I also lived in Canada, about six months, it was also a great experience. The cold weather and the snow are some of my favorite things in the world. I worked in Mexico City for about a year as well, but I’m afraid to say, did not love it very much. I prefer smaller more calmed cities, the bustling life of CDMX just wasn’t for me. </p>
            <p> Currently I’m developing my own marketing and design agency (yay!) with a business partner/best friend. It’s a lot of work, and I mean a lot, but so definitely worth it. 
           On my down time a really enjoy reading, a new habit of mine, and drawing, an old one. I also try to squeeze in some yoga practices, but unfortunately its getting harder and harder to do so. </p>
